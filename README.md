## To run the project

Run College Recommendation System.py using Python 3.7 version

## About the project

•	The university recommendation system assumes a significant role as university choice requires a great deal of study of the quantity of variables according to the future perspective. Looking for a decent university is a tough job for a graduate who needs to seek after his/her higher studies.

•	Graduates look for different angles like university campus, teaching staffs, extracurricular exercises in universities, foundation of universities, and so on, even the surveys of university is looked to get additional affirmation about the subtleties.

•	University Recommendation System will prescribe great universities to a graduate depending on his/her decision of field, top evaluations, area and past rate. It is significant as it diminishes the manual work and robotizes this with the assistance of software.

•	In this recommendation system, The CSV file that is dataset is split into train and test data in python machine learning. We used supervise machine learning algorithm to split data around 20% to 80% between testing and training stages. We used pandas for importing the dataset that is CSV file and SKLEARN for splitting the dataset.

•	Here prediction is on the basis of GRE score, TOEFL score and CGPA. The trained data is fitted in the model to make to predictions by using any machine algorithm.

•	We can use hybrid concept that is more than one algorithm to get better accuracy for the system. So we have applied three machine learning algorithms that is linear regression (which is used to solve regression problems), SVM (Support Vector Machine is used to solve classification or regression problems) and KNN (K Nearest Neighbours which is used to solve both classification problems and regression problems).

•	The most accurate algorithm amongst the three is KNN for this recommendation system. This system will the recommend top 10 universities to the users.

•	KNN gives first preference to GRE score, SVM gives first preference to CGPA and Linear Regression gives first preference to TOEFL score.KNN gives 91% to 94% accuracy, SVM gives 85% to 90% accuracy and linear regression gives 81% to 85% accuracy.
